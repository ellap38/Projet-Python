# Projet-Python
check_start_met.py : This script allows us to check all the protein sequences that starts with a methionine
(represented as the letter "M" in the standard IUPAC single letter amino acid code),and count how many records fail this.

convert.py : This script allows us to convert a sequence file from  GenBank file NC_000913.gbk. to a FASTA file NC_000913.fna.

filter1.1.py : This script allows us to filter a sequence file. By running this script  we can filter a FASTA file by length to exclude protein
sequences with less than 100 amino acids long.

filter1.2.py : This script allows us to filter a sequence file. By running this script  we can filter a FASTA file by length to exclude protein
sequences with less than 100 amino acids long.

filter2.py : This script allows us to work with Sequence Features. By running this script we can have a readable display of a key property of a string CDS.

edit.py : This script allows us to pull out  particular sequences from a large sequence file.In this case,  we edit sequences to to take everything up to but excluding the final letter.

total_gene_lenghts.py : This script loops over all the features looking for gene records, and calculates their total length.

count_fasta.py : This script allows us to read assorted sequence file.

count_record.py : This script allows us to read assorted sequence file.
